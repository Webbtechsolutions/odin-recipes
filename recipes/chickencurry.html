    <h2> Steps to cook </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole dish or large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and a generous pinch of salt and fry for 8-10 mins, or until the onion has turned golden brown and sticky. Add the garlic and ginger, cooking for a further minute.</p></li>
            
            
            <li><p>Chop the chicken into chunky 3cm pieces, add to the pan and fry for 5 mins before stirring through the spice paste and tomatoes, along with 250ml water.

    <h2> How to thicken the curry sauce </h2>
    <p> If you find your sauce is on the runny side, there are several ways to fix this. Here are our top 3 methods: </p>

    <ol>
        <li> Simmering gently on a low temperature will reduce the volume of liquid as well as intensifying the flavour of the curry.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp cornflour to 2-3 tbsp of cold water to form a slurry. Then add this to the curry and simmer until it thickens.</li>
            <li>Add a few tbsp of Greek yogurt, which will give the curry a lovely creamy consistency too.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2> Enjoy! </h2>
